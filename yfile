The following information is from https://curl.se/docs/httpscripting.html:
Using curl we can reproduce http methods:
 - GET curl localhost:80
 - HEAD curl --head localhost:80
 - POST curl --data "birthyear=1905" localhost:80 / -d works too
 - PUT curl --upload-file Makefile localhost:80
 - GET+cookie curl --cookie "name=Daniel" localhost:80
 - ANY curl -X ANY(DELETE for ex.) -> will work but not best apparently


 To check if a path is valid in a C++ manner (metacharacters not allowed)
 	std::ifstream s(char *path);
	s.good();

for PUT request, need to change default size fo buffer[30000] to a malloc of some kind, currently put fails if file_size > 30000 even with client_max_bocy_size way bigger than that

Not allowed in C++98:
	- string.back()/front()
	- string.pop_back()/pop_front()
	- std::to_string()
	- fstream(string) -> should use fstream(char *) instead
