The following information is from https://curl.se/docs/httpscripting.html:
Using curl we can reproduce http methods:
 - GET curl localhost:80
 - HEAD curl --head localhost:80
 - POST curl --data "birthyear=1905" localhost:80 / -d works too
 - PUT curl --upload-file Makefile localhost:80
 - GET+cookie curl --cookie "name=Daniel" localhost:80
 - ANY curl -X ANY(DELETE for ex.) -> will work but not best apparently


 To check if a path is valid in a C++ manner (metacharacters not allowed)
 	std::ifstream s(char *path);
	s.good();
