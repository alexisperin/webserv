The following information is from https://curl.se/docs/httpscripting.html:
Using curl we can reproduce http methods:
 - GET curl localhost:80
 - HEAD curl --head localhost:80
 - POST curl --data "birthyear=1905" localhost:80 / -d works too
 - PUT curl --upload-file Makefile localhost:80
 - GET+cookie curl --cookie "name=Daniel" localhost:80
 - ANY curl -X ANY(DELETE for ex.) -> will work but not best apparently


 To check if a path is valid in a C++ manner (metacharacters not allowed)
 	std::ifstream s(char *path);
	s.good();


~/Documents not working in .conf file

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nginx-location-directive
Basicly the url above tells us we still have a lot to do for the locations

Not allowed in C++98:
	- string.back()/front()
	- string.pop_back()/pop_front()
	- std::to_string()
	- fstream(string) -> should use fstream(char *) instead


cgi_env:
 -REQUEST_METHOD="GET" (ex)
 -SERVER_PROTOCOL="HTTP/1.1"
 -PATH_INFO=

execve is for executables, not python scripts


TO DO:
	good - directory listing(autoindex)
	- server names ???
	good - body_size in locations
	- body in DELETE ??
	- PATH_INFo in cgi
	- PUT with b.i.g. file sometimes stops
	good - .bla in location
	- 414 Request-URI Too Long
